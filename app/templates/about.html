<h1> About </h1>


Based off an [old college assignment](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall15/cos126/assignments/markov.html), this project uses basic natural language processing to generate semi-plausible text.

<h2> How it works </h2>

The algorithm divides the input text into k-grams, and for each k-gram, forms a frequency table for the following character.

When generating text, the algorithm looks at the current k-gram and selects a random character based off the weighted distribution of the frequency table.

The algorithm incorporates the character into the next k-gram and repeats the process.

Called a Markov chain, the algorithm produces long strings of semi-believable text.

Find the GitHub for the code here.

<h2> Project Design </h2>

I coded the Markov chain in Python and hosted it on Heroku with the Flask micro web framework. I wrote a CSS/HTML/JavaScript GUI to mimic the effect of the Terminal when originally testing the algorithm. For the animation I used the <a href = "https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/">Typed.js library</a>.

Because the output was especially amusing for song lyrics, I connected another version to the [RapGenius API](https://genius.com/developers), which you can find <a href="">here</a>.
